# LawinServer
1) Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Run "install_packages.bat" (This file isn't required after the packages are installed.)
3) Run "start.bat", It should say "Started listening on port 3551"
4) Use something to redirect the fortnite servers to dababy.jooghubi.repl.co (Which could be fiddler, psychopasts custom lawinserver launcher, ssl bypass that redirects servers, etc...)
